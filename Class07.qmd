## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(readr)
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/UK-foods"
x <- read.csv(url)

```



```{r}
nrow(x)
ncol(x)
dim(x)
```
>Q1. How many rows and columns are in your new data frame named x? What R functions could you use to answer this questions?

17 Rows, 4 Columns and I used dim(x) to find the "dimensions" of my graph. 



```{r}
head(x)
```


```{r}
rownames(x) <- x[,1]
x <- x[,-1]
head(x)
```

```{r}
dim(x)
```
```{r}
x <- read.csv(url, row.names=1)
head(x)
```
>Q2. Which approach to solving the ‘row-names problem’ mentioned above do you prefer and why? Is one approach more robust than another under certain circumstances?

The second approach is more efficient, the less lines of code you have to do the thing you need the better so it is more reproducible and runs efficiently. 

```{r}
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside=T, col=rainbow(nrow(x)))
```


>Q3: Changing what optional argument in the above barplot() function results in the following plot?

```{r}
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside=F, col=rainbow(nrow(x)))
```
```{r}
pairs(x, col=rainbow(10), pch=16)
```

>Q5: Generating all pairwise plots may help somewhat. Can you make sense of the following code and resulting figure? What does it mean if a given point lies on the diagonal for a given plot?

```{r}
pairs(x, col=rainbow(10), pch=16)
```
>Q6. What is the main differences between N. Ireland and the other countries of the UK in terms of this data-set?

North of ireland is very different front the rest of the datasets in terms of variance. 

```{r}
pca <- prcomp( t(x) )
summary(pca)
```
>Q7. Complete the code below to generate a plot of PC1 vs PC2. The second line adds text labels over the data points.


```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], xlab="PC1", ylab="PC2", xlim=c(-270,500))
text(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], colnames(x))
```

>Q8. Customize your plot so that the colors of the country names match the colors in our UK and Ireland map and table at start of this document.

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], xlab="PC1", ylab="PC2", xlim=c(-270,500))
text(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], colnames(x))

```
```{r}
v <- round( pca$sdev^2/sum(pca$sdev^2) * 100 )
v
```

```{r}
barplot(v, xlab="Principal Component", ylab="Percent Variation")
```
```{r}
## Lets focus on PC1 as it accounts for > 90% of variance 
par(mar=c(10, 3, 0.35, 0))
barplot( pca$rotation[,1], las=2 )
```


```{r}

```
